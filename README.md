# FEM-matlab-octave
M-files and examples for FEM with Matlab and/or Octave

During my many years at university, I created some matlab packages for Finite Element Modelling.
After leaving university (retirement) I switched as much as possible to octave.

I started this Github repository in februari 2022, so it is work under development.
